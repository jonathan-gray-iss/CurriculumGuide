\noindent Fall and Spring Semesters - 0.5 Credits

\vspace{1mm}\emph{The 8th grade art wheel allows each student to work with the arts faculty to explore the ways the arts can impact their general experience at Springs and beyond. Students are led through projects that help them become better creative and critical thinking through questions like: What is the difference between Hearing and Listening? How does music impact your experience? How can concepts like measurement and precision help us design and communicate/express ideas? How can we use drawing to record and communicate? How can digital tools help express ideas? How is photography a way to appreciate memory? How is photography a model for appreciating technical crafts and the care that goes into the process of making a photograph? How is singing a way to express oneself individually or as a community? How does your community connect through song? (Or shared stories?) How do writers and stage designers literally set the stage to tell stories? How is communication an important part of a community? How can we be better communicators and storytellers?}\\

%\vspace{1mm}\emph{The Illustration course has been described by students as “a book club that is also a drawing club”. It encourages students to engage with text in a new way, and become deeper readers. Texts used are intentionally varied, but there is focus on Ray Brdbury’s “The Illustrated Man” and Italo Calvino’s series of stories “Marcovaldo” and “Invisible Cities”. Good Reads website says of Marcovaldo: “Marcovaldo is an unskilled worker in a drab industrial city in northern Italy. He is an irrepressible dreamer and an inveterate schemer. Much to the puzzlement of his wife, his children, his boss, and his neighbors, he chases his dreams - but the results are never the ones he had expected.”}\\
