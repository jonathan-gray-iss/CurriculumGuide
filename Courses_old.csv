All pieces to be exhibited are produced completely by hand development and production methods. Introduction to Photography and a 35mm SLR camera with manual settings are required.",0.5,Arts
Art History - F,"Art History is one of the broadest and deepest disciplines in the humanities. In the 10th grade semester survey course students will examine the visual arts from the Paleolithic era to the present. The course will employ a variety of critical, theoretical and methodological perspectives and approaches.  The main goal is to equip students with visual literacy to allow them to effectively navigate the contemporary experience",0.5,Arts
2D Design - F,"In this course, students explore various approaches to drawing and painting. They discover how to create space and form through mark making, value, perspective, and color. Subjects include still life, landscape, portrait, and the human figure. Learning about the principles of design strengthens students&#8217; compositions. By keeping a sketchbook/journal, students have the opportunity for further practice and exploration of individual interests.",0.5,Arts
3D Design - S,"This course introduces the hand-building techniques of pinch, coil, and slab. Students learn proper blending of feet, rims, handles, and decorations. They then begin working on the wheel. In addition, they learn to model representational sculptures and make a clay mold for a plaster sculptural relief. They work with both glazes and stains. Concepts covered include balance, proportions, an aesthetic flow from one area of interest to another, and contrasts in texture, value, and color.",0.5,Arts
Advanced Sculpture Methods - S,"This class continues exploring both functional and non-functional three-dimensional design. Students are asked to find various means of organizing and interpreting form, making creative thinking as important as technique. There is greater individual choice of materials within the format of projects involving elements and principles of design. Students investigate ideas through a sketchbook/journal.",0.5,Arts
Advanced Drawing and Painting,"This class builds on the skills and concepts introduced in the beginning level class. Students gain an understanding of the qualities of a wider range of media, choosing the appropriate material for the desired form of expression. Initially, the goal is to strengthen representational skills. Later projects demand greater expressiveness or inventiveness.  Students gain an artistic vocabulary and experience in analyzing works of art, by both master artists and each other.",0.5,Arts
Woodworking - F,"In this course, students learn the fundamentals of working with wood by building a musical instrument, either a backpacking guitar or a mountain dulcimer. They learn the properties of various woods and the proper use of power and hand tools. This course is not offered every year.",0.5,Arts
Recording Arts - F,"This is a semester course designed to introduce students to the principles of sound engineering and production. As with any art, there are technical skills that must be learned in order to make a creative expression. Objectives in Recording Arts are both technical and creative. Technical objectives include learning about sound and acoustics as well as developing the &ldquo;ear&rdquo; of the students; that is, increasing their ability to interpret better what they hear. Becoming familiar with equipment by hands-on experience in a multi-track recording studio is also part of the technical side. Students are exposed to analog and digital formats.
During the course the class does a production of a song. Producing involves arrangement, recording and mixing tracks of instruments and vocals. This project serves as a vehicle for producing a sound picture. The sound picture is the focus of the course. The same tracks can sound many different ways depending on the equalization (the ability to increase or decrease the volume of selected frequencies of an individual track), panning (the ability to place a track anywhere in the stereo spectrum), effects (choruses, early reflections, delays, etc.), reverberation and the relative volumes of the instruments with one another and with the vocals.
Deciding upon the blend of these parameters is mixing, the heart of Recording Arts. For example, if the music is rhythmical, certain special effects can accent or punctuate the rhythm. Another example is the selection of the type of reverberation. Some types of reverberation can give a full sound to a recording while other types can add to a haunting feel. Mixing falls into the creative side of the course since the way the song will sound is a matter of interpretation and expression of the one at the controls. This is where the sound picture is painted. The sound of the final product is integrated with the song and its arrangement, adding to the total feel of the music, which in turn strengthens the emotional connection with the listener.
Recording Arts is largely a laboratory-type course, and therefore, attendance and participation are essential. The students take increasing control of the studio and project as the semester moves along. One of the goals is to let them &ldquo;run the ship&rdquo; by the end of the course.",0.5,Arts
Acting I - F,"Open to all students, whether novice actor or veteran performer, this course introduces the basics of acting: concentration, relaxation, observation, and characterization. Students learn juggling and pantomime techniques and use daily improvisations and theater games to build characterization skills and create original material for performance. At the end of the semester, they perform short scenes and monologues, both scripted and original. Additionally, students attend and critique local theater performances.",0.5,Arts
Acting II - F,"Acting II is a course for actors ready for advanced work. These students explore the dramatic aspects of the acting craft. Improvisation is used as a process instead of a performance. Various approaches to acting are studied including Stanislavski, Meisner, Benedetti, and others. A showcase of scenes and monologues is presented at the end of the semester. To enroll, students must have completed Acting I or have the permission of the instructor.",0.5,Arts
Stagecraft - F,"In this course, students learn the basics of set construction and scenery and lighting design. They build, paint, light a set and serve as stage crew for one major Indian Springs theater production during the semester. In addition, students set up and run lights, sound, and media for Town Meetings and other school functions on a rotating basis.",0.5,Arts
Choir,"Choir is a year-long course, taken without credit. Many Indian Springs students participate in the choir. The 150-member Concert Choir practices daily during school hours. The smaller, 60-member Chamber Choir rehearses on Monday evenings. Through these rigorous musical experiences, students have the opportunity to sing for a variety of audiences from elementary school children to symphony goers.",0,Arts
Music History - F,"This course examines musical style. After students develop basic skills in analysis, they apply these skills to a survey of music history. A few of the major composers, genres, forms and style characteristics are examined for each historical period. Students develop a perspective that is aural as well as verbal. All sophomores must take either this course or Tenth-Grade Art History.",0.5,Arts
Musical Ensemble Performance,"In this yearlong course, students undertake the study and performance of selected classical works for ensembles of two or more musicians.

Students develop an understanding of the fundamentals of music by listening, performing, creating, and analyzing music.  Topics covered include music terminology, notation skills, four-part harmonization, basic composition, music analysis, and basic ear training.",0.5,Arts
AP Music Theory - S,"This class prepares students for the AP Music Theory exam by developing their ability to recognize, understand, and describe the basic materials and processes that are heard or presented in a score. Students develop their aural, sight-singing, written, compositional, and analytical skills through listening, performance, and analytical exercises. Topics covered include notation, keys, modes, intervals, chords, Roman numeral analysis, four-part chorale writing, musical analysis, and melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic dictation. This class is not designed for beginner-level musicians, but rather for students who are interested in the analytical aspects of music.

Creative Writing,"A course with multiple goals, this semester elective introduces strategies for analyzing and evaluating creative writing; focuses on developing individual students&#8217; writing skills, interests, and talents; and explores models of good writing in fiction, poetry, and creative non-fiction, drawn from sources such as Writing Fiction (Burroway and Weinberg) and The Making of a Poem: A Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms. Because writing is a means of self-discovery as well as self-expression, students keep journals to start &#8220;writing down the bones, the essential, awake speech of their minds,&#8221; following Natalie Goldberg&#8217;s advice to all writers. Students are also required to submit a portfolio of work and to help develop and contribute to a class-produced literary magazine.",0.5,English
