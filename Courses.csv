"1510","Recording Arts - F","1","This is a semester course designed to introduce students to the principles of sound engineering and production. As with any art, there are technical skills that must be learned in order to make a creative expression. Objectives in Recording Arts are both technical and creative. Technical objectives include learning about sound and acoustics as well as developing the &ldquo;ear&rdquo; of the students; that is, increasing their ability to interpret better what they hear. Becoming familiar with equipment by hands-on experience in a multi-track recording studio is also part of the technical side. Students are exposed to analog and digital formats.
During the course the class does a production of a song. Producing involves arrangement, recording and mixing tracks of instruments and vocals. This project serves as a vehicle for producing a sound picture. The sound picture is the focus of the course. The same tracks can sound many different ways depending on the equalization (the ability to increase or decrease the volume of selected frequencies of an individual track), panning (the ability to place a track anywhere in the stereo spectrum), effects (choruses, early reflections, delays, etc.), reverberation and the relative volumes of the instruments with one another and with the vocals.
Deciding upon the blend of these parameters is mixing, the heart of Recording Arts. For example, if the music is rhythmical, certain special effects can accent or punctuate the rhythm. Another example is the selection of the type of reverberation. Some types of reverberation can give a full sound to a recording while other types can add to a haunting feel. Mixing falls into the creative side of the course since the way the song will sound is a matter of interpretation and expression of the one at the controls. This is where the sound picture is painted. The sound of the final product is integrated with the song and its arrangement, adding to the total feel of the music, which in turn strengthens the emotional connection with the listener.
Recording Arts is largely a laboratory-type course, and therefore, attendance and participation are essential. The students take increasing control of the studio and project as the semester moves along. One of the goals is to let them &ldquo;run the ship&rdquo; by the end of the course.","0.5","Arts"

"1520","Recording Arts - S","1","This is a semester course designed to introduce students to the principles of sound engineering and production. As with any art, there are technical skills that must be learned in order to make a creative expression. Objectives in Recording Arts are both technical and creative. Technical objectives include learning about sound and acoustics as well as developing the &ldquo;ear&rdquo; of the students; that is, increasing their ability to interpret better what they hear. Becoming familiar with equipment by hands-on experience in a multi-track recording studio is also part of the technical side. Students are exposed to analog and digital formats.
During the course the class does a production of a song. Producing involves arrangement, recording and mixing tracks of instruments and vocals. This project serves as a vehicle for producing a sound picture. The sound picture is the focus of the course. The same tracks can sound many different ways depending on the equalization (the ability to increase or decrease the volume of selected frequencies of an individual track), panning (the ability to place a track anywhere in the stereo spectrum), effects (choruses, early reflections, delays, etc.), reverberation and the relative volumes of the instruments with one another and with the vocals.
Deciding upon the blend of these parameters is mixing, the heart of Recording Arts. For example, if the music is rhythmical, certain special effects can accent or punctuate the rhythm. Another example is the selection of the type of reverberation. Some types of reverberation can give a full sound to a recording while other types can add to a haunting feel. Mixing falls into the creative side of the course since the way the song will sound is a matter of interpretation and expression of the one at the controls. This is where the sound picture is painted. The sound of the final product is integrated with the song and its arrangement, adding to the total feel of the music, which in turn strengthens the emotional connection with the listener.
Recording Arts is largely a laboratory-type course, and therefore, attendance and participation are essential. The students take increasing control of the studio and project as the semester moves along. One of the goals is to let them &ldquo;run the ship&rdquo; by the end of the course.","0.5","Arts"
